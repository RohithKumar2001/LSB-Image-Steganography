# LSB-Image-Steganography
This project focuses on concealing data within the least significant bits of digital images, enabling covert communication. I utilized LSB steganography to encode a secret text message, of variable length, extracted from a file, into the least significant bits (LSB) of the bytes composing an image in BMP file format while preserving their visual uprightness.
